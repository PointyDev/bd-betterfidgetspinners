## How to install
Please install [BetterDiscord](http://betterdiscord.net) and refer to [this guide](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp/wiki/Themes#how-to-add-a-theme).
### Download (recommended): [Auto-updating version](http://betterdiscord.net/ghdl/?url=https://github.com/PointyDev/bd-betterfidgetspinners/blob/master/BetterFidgetSpinners.theme.css)

### Alternatively, 
You can put the following in your custom CSS and restart:
```css
/* BetterFidgetSpinners™ Auto-Updating Theme */
@import url(https://rawgit.com/PointyDev/bd-betterfidgetspinners/master/src/BetterFidgetSpinners.css);
```
(Does not work with BetterCustomCSS)

#### Why isn't this in the official #theme-repo?
Some mod kept on deleting it because they don't know what a joke is.
